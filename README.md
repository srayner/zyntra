# ðŸ“¡ **Zyntra**

_Fast Command Control for Arduino Projects_

---

## âœ¨ Overview

**Zyntra** is a lightweight, flexible communication protocol for controlling microcontrollers (like Arduino) over a serial interface.  
It is designed for reliable, fast, and structured execution of commands such as servo movements, pin I/O, NeoPixel control, and system operations.

Zyntra provides a clean and efficient way to send compact command packets, with built-in error checking and easy parsing.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fast and reliable serial communication
- Lightweight packet structure with checksum validation
- Support for:
  - Servo control (attach, move, detach)
  - Digital and analog I/O (read/write)
  - NeoPixel setup and control
  - System commands (ping, reset, version)
  - Configuration save/load (EEPROM)
- Designed for Arduino Nano, Uno, Mega (and compatible boards)
- Easy to extend with new command types

## ðŸ›  Packet Format

| Field      | Size (bytes) | Description                     |
| :--------- | :----------- | :------------------------------ |
| Start Byte | 1            | Always `0xAA`                   |
| Length     | 1            | Payload length (Command + Args) |
| Command ID | 1            | Command identifier              |
| Arguments  | n            | Command-specific arguments      |
| Checksum   | 1            | XOR of all previous bytes       |

Example packet to move a servo:

...
[0xAA] [0x03] [0x32] [pin] [position] [checksum]
...
